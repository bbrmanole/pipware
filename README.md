# Hardware Requirements
This project was designed to create a portable and functional Pipboy device. For this, you will need:
* #### A Raspberry Pi 4 or higher rev
  - [![Visit Site - Raspberry Pi](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visit_Site-Raspberry_Pi-red?logo=raspberrypi&logoColor=white)](https://raspberrypi.com/ "Go To Raspberry Pi Homepage")
  - [![RPi Imager - RaspberryPiOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/RPi_Imager-RaspberryPiOS-red?logo=raspberrypi&logoColor=white)](https://raspberrypi.com/software/ "Go to Raspberry Pi Software Page")
* #### TFT Touchscreen 2.8in 480x360 display
  - [![Repo - TFT Display Driver](https://img.shields.io/badge/Repo-TFT_Display_Driver-blue?logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show/ "Go To LCD-show Repository Page")

* A stylus (usually comes with the display)

### The wiring diagram can be found here:
[![TFT display information - lcdwiki.com](https://img.shields.io/badge/TFT_display_information-lcdwiki.com-lightgrey)](https://www.lcdwiki.com/2.8inch_RPi_Display/ "lcdwiki.com/2.8inch_RPi_Display")

# Instructions
## Hardware:
### Notice: wiring a touchscreen display is not necessary, since the program will run on any display with a pointing device (mouse or stylus). Use a touchscreen display if you want to make the RaspberryPi portable. If you are going to use a display check out the <a href="#hardware-requirements">Hardware Requirements</a> and follow the steps below:

* ### 1. Follow the wiring diagram (see <a href="#hardware-requirements">Hardware Requirements</a>)


* ### 2. After wiring the display to the Pi, you will need to install an LCD driver. We recommend the LCD-show driver packages from goodtft on GitHub (see <a href="#hardware-requirements">Hardware Requirements</a> or [click here](https://github.com/goodtft/LCD-show/ "Go to LCD-show repository page"))

* ### 3. After installing the LCD display driver and ensuring the touchscreen works as intended, you can move on to the software section

## Software:

### Before installing the firmware, you'll need to install RaspberryPiOS onto your RaspberryPi. Use a microSD card for best results, and follow the instructions on the official RaspberryPi website, which you can find [here](https://raspberrypi.com/software/ "Download Page for the RaspberryPi Imager") or click the badge below:
[![RPi Imager - RaspberryPiOS](https://img.shields.io/badge/RPi_Imager-RaspberryPiOS-red?logo=raspberrypi&logoColor=white)](https://raspberrypi.com/software)

### A bash install wizard script is provided in the repository files, as this project uses multiple Python dependencies that need to be installed for it to work ([requirements file](https://github.com/bbrmanole/pipware/blob/main/requirements.txt)).
### Notice: this program was only tested on the RaspberryPiOS, for best results execute the following instructions on the Raspberry Pi.
To install and use write the following in the terminal:

## 1. Clone this repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/bbrmanole/pipware
```

## 2. Go into the directory:
```bash
$ cd pipware
```

## 3. Run the install script (this will install all required dependencies, requires root privileges):
```bash
$ sudo ./install.sh
```

## 4. Run the firmware:
```bash
$ python3 main.py
```
